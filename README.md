Upload Your Image

How To Use The Website:
You launch the website by clicking on the file called index.html
Click on the “Add Image” button to upload the image
The image will appear as a greyscale image and then you continue to the next step which is the scaling using the “Edit” button which has the name of the file on it as well.
When you get to the editing page you get 2 options which are the “Nearest-Neighbour Interpolation” button or the “Bilinear interpolation” button.
Once you choose the option 2 pop ups will specify the factors that will scale the image where the first factor will scale horizontally and the second factor will scale vertically.
Once you choose the factors you will be directed to a page with the result image where you can download by right-clicking the image and “save image as” on any place on your computer.
After all that enjoy your new scaled up or down gray scaled image 😊.
